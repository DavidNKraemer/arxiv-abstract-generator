This is a readme!

We're making an arxiv abstract generator - input a name and a set of arxiv tags and we will give you an abstract.

The dataset was pulled from kaggle and will be included.

The software pieces we need to figure out and do:

 - Know how the dataset is structured.
 - Set up a properly working pytorch.

Conceptual pieces to understand:

 - NOT using n-grams.
 - Transformer model? What is that. (And all conceptual dependencies).
 - Read how BERT and GPT work

Week 1 goals:
 - Understand conceptually how this project fits into the transformer model framework.
 - Download pytorch, get it running, play around.
 	- Specifically, get text tutorials working.
 - Goal is to have a product at end. Optimally, have a demo.
